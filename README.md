# The Raytracer Challenge
This is my code for the book "The Ray Tracer Challenge" from Jamis Buck.
The raytracer is completely written in Typescript, unit tests have been
implemented with JEST.

## Chapter 1-5
Chapter 1-5 code is in the spikes/ directory, written for NodeJS. 


## Project setup
After cloning the repo, run "npm install" from the TheRaytracerChallenge and the 
TheRaytracerChallenge/test directory. Then you can open the workspace file
workspace.code-workspace with VS Code. There are launch configurations
for Chrome and Firefox for starting the website.
For the unit tests, it is convenient to have an extension for Jest installed
(for example "JEST Runner"), but it also works by running "npm test"
from the test directory.
